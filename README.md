# Udemy's Modern React with Redux 2019

This repo contains coding exercises that were created when I followed [Udemy's Modern React with Redux 2019](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4) video courses, authored by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider).

## Coding Exercises

- [jsx](https://github.com/WendySanarwanto/udemy-modern-react-with-redux-2019/tree/master/jsx) - Demonstrate how to render HTML tags by using `JSX` markups, within main App function-based component. Takeaways: 

    * jsx (`div`, `label`, `input`, `button`, custom tag of a component).
    
    * function-based component.

- [components](https://github.com/WendySanarwanto/udemy-modern-react-with-redux-2019/tree/master/components) - Demonstrate how to display a list of objects in a list of components, by using ES6's `map` array method, `jsx`, splitted the list item component into multiple components and styled by using [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com)'s stylings. Takeaways: 

    * ES6 `Array.map` method to map list of data as a list of JSX components.

    * Component slicing & compositing.

    * Semantic-ui stylings: `card`, `container`, `comments`,`avatar`, `comment`, `header`, `content`, `metadata`.
    
    * `props.children` - render child component , passed in as props.

- [pics](https://github.com/WendySanarwanto/udemy-modern-react-with-redux-2019/tree/master/pics) - Demonstrate how to call 3rd party API by using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library and display the call's result list as a CSS grid-styled list component. Takeaways: 

    * Make API Call request through using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library.

    * Eliminating redundant code which setup API Request call's common parameters through creating a custom [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) instance.

    * Passing down data/state from Parent component to direct children components through `props` system.

    * Propagate data/state (e.g. User's inputs) from children component to its direct Parent component through passing down parent component's Callback method via `props` system.

    * Prevent `form`'s submission from doing actual postback by calling form event arg's `preventDefault` method.
    
    * Semantic-ui stylings: `segment`, `form`, `field`, `iamge-list`.

    * Manipulating DOM tag in runtime by using `Ref` system.

    * Grid layout styling by using CSS-Grid.
